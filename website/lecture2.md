# Lecture 2

<!-- \toc -->

## Objective
### :books: Physics: ODEs and PDEs
- 1D ODE: reaction
- 1D PDE: diffusion
- 1D advection

### :computer: Code: GitHub
- Get started using GitHub:
  - git basics
  - Add first items to the Git repo to make it "Julia-ready"

### :construction: Exercises
- `n` volcanic bombs
- `n` volcanic bombs vectorised
- Reaction-Diffusion-Advection code
- Create a repository and upload code + `README`
- Personal Julia install
