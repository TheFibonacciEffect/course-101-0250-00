## Exercise 2 - ** Operator-splitting for advection-diffusion**
"""

#md # ðŸ‘‰ See [Logistics](/logistics/#submission) for submission details.

md"""
Operator-splitting for advection-diffusion, we do the implicit diffusion in PT-loop, followed by one step of advection, thus we could use optimal time step for advection
