# Exercises - lecture 6

\warn{**Exercise 1 has to be handed in as Jupyter notebook** on Moodle and included in the this week's exercise folder on your GitHub repository.

Other exercises have to be handed in, as usual, as monolithic Julia scripts (one code per script) and uploaded to your private (shared) GitHub repository, in a **specific folder for each lecture**. The git commit hash (or SHA) of the final push needs to be uploaded on Moodle ([more](/homework)).}
