# Lecture 1

**Welcome to ETH's course 101-0250-00L on solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in parallel on graphical processing units (GPUs) with the Julia language.**

> **Course structure**\
> The course structure includes following 3 items, to bring in new material each course both for the "physics-numerics" (aka physics) and the "code-management" (aka code), as well as propose exercises for those concepts:
> 1. Physics: equations, discretisation, implementation, solver, visualisation
> 2. Code: technical, Julia, GitHub
> 3. Exercises

## Objective

### :bulb: Intro to Julia, JupyterHub/Jupyter notebooks
- Julia basics
- Julia package manager/system
- Environments
- Tips and tricks: Revise, debugging

### :books: Solving simple problems numerically
- Initial conditions
- Time loop
- Visulisation

### :computer: Code: Git and GitHub
- Get started on GitHub:
  - Create an account
  - Create a repo for the course to track your progress in the class

### :construction: Exercises
- Money in the bank (update, rate of change)
- Car travelling 1, 2 directions
- Volcanic bomb
- _(optional)_ orbital
