# Solving PDEs in parallel on GPUs with Julia

🎉 Welcome to ETH's **course 101-0250-00L** on solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in parallel on graphical processing units (GPUs) with the [Julia programming language](http://www.julialang.org/).

> **Announce:** lectures start at 12h45 every Tuesday ([more](/logistics/#lectures))

> ⚠️ The requirement for a Covid certificate applies from Monday, 20 September 2021 for teachers and students. For further questions, please see the [Coronavirus FAQs for Students](https://ethz.ch/services/en/news-and-events/coronavirus/students.html).

### Objective
The goal of this course is to offer a practical approach to solve systems of differential equations in parallel on GPUs using the [Julia programming language](http://www.julialang.org/). Julia combines high-level language conciseness to low-level language performance which enables efficient code development. The Julia GPU applications will be hosted on a git-platform and implement modern software development practices.


### Outline
- **Part 1**  _Introduction_
  - The Julia language
  - Basic physical processes
  - Spatial and temporal discretisation
  - Software development tools (Git, CI)

- **Part 2**  _Solving PDEs on GPUs_
  - Parallel and GPU computing
  - Simulation performance limiters
  - Efficient iterative algorithms
  - Distributed computing
  - Advanced physics

- **Part 3** _Final project_
  
  Solve a solid mechanics or fluid dynamics problem of your interest, such as:
  - the shallow water / ice equation
  - acoustic wave propagation, nonlinear diffusion
  - viscous flow or elastic deformation
  - viscous or elastic poromechanics
  - frictional heating
  - and more...
