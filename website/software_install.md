## Opening and running the Jupyter Julia notebook

### Course slides and lecture material
Most of the course slides are a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/); a browser-based computational notebook.

You can follow the lecture along live at [https://achtzack01.ethz.ch/](https://achtzack01.ethz.ch/), login with your nethz-name and an arbitrary password (**but don't use your nethz password**).  _You have to be within the ETHZ network or use a VPN connection._

Code cells are executed by putting the cursor into the cell and hitting `shift + enter`. For more info see the [documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

### Exercises and homework
The first two lecture's homework assignments will be [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). You'll find them on [https://achtzack01.ethz.ch/](https://achtzack01.ethz.ch/) as well. You can execute them on the server or download and run them them locally as well.

For submission, download the final `.ipynb` notebooks from the server, or collect the local `.ipynb` notebooks into a single local folder you then upload to Moodle. See [Logistics](/logistics) and [Homework](/homework) for details.

Starting from lecture 3, exercise scripts will be mostly standalone regular Julia scripts that have to be uploaded to your private git repo (shared with the teaching staff only). Details in [Logistics](/logistics/#submission).

\warn{The `achtzack01` is **not** backed up. Make sure to keep local copy of your data!}

## Installing Julia v1.6 (or later)
Check you have an active internet connexion and [download Julia v1.6](https://julialang.org/downloads/) for your platform following the install directions provided under **[help]**.

Alternatively, open a terminal and download the binaries (select the one for your platform):
```sh
wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/winnt/x64/1.6/julia-1.6.3-win64.exe # Windows
wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/mac/x64/1.6/julia-1.6.3-mac64.dmg # macOS
wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64/1.6/julia-1.6.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz # Linux x86
```
Then extract them and add Julia to `PATH` (usually done in your `.bashrc`, `.profile`, or `config` file).

> **Note for Windows users**\
> When installing Julia 1.6 on Windows, make sure to check the "Add PATH" tick or ensure Julia is on PATH (see **[help]**). Julia's REPL has a built-in shell mode you can access typing `;` that natively works on Unix-based systems. On Windows, you can access the Windows shell by typing `Powershell` within the shell mode, and exit it typing `exit`, as described [here](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#man-shell-mode).

### Terminal + external editor
Ensure you have a text editor with syntax highlighting support for Julia. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/download) and [Atom](https://atom.io) can be recommended.

From within the terminal, type
```sh
julia
```
to make sure that the Julia REPL (aka terminal) starts. Then you should ba able to add `1+1` and verify you get the expected result. Exit with `Ctrl-d`.

### VS Code
If you'd enjoy a more IDE type of environment, [check out VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Follow the [installation directions](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode#getting-started) for the [Julia VS Code extension](https://www.julia-vscode.org).


## Running Julia

### First steps
Now that you have a running Julia install, launch Julia (e.g. by typing `julia` in the shell since it should be on path)
```sh
julia
```

Welcome in the [Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/) (command window). There, you have 3 "modes", the standard
```julia-repl
[user@comp ~]$ julia
               _
   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org
  (_)     | (_) (_)    |
   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type "?" for help, "]?" for Pkg help.
  | | | | | | |/ _` |  |
  | | |_| | | | (_| |  |  Version 1.6.3 (2021-09-23)
 _/ |\__'_|_|_|\__'_|  |  Official https://julialang.org/ release
|__/                   |

julia> 
```
the shell mode by hitting `;`, where you can enter Unix commands,
```julia-repl
shell> 
```
and the [Pkg mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#Pkg-mode) (package manager) by hitting `]`, that will be used to add and manage packages, and environments,
```julia-repl
(@v1.6) pkg> 
```

You can interactively execute commands in the REPL, like adding two numbers
```julia-repl
julia> 2+2
4

julia>
```
Within this class, we will mainly work with Julia scripts. You can run them using the `include()` function in the REPL
```julia-repl
julia> include("my_script.jl")
```
Alternatively, you can also execute a Julia script from the shell
```sh
julia -O3 --check-bounds=no my_script.jl
```
here passing the `-O3` optimisation flag, and the Julia `--check-bounds` flag set to `no` in order to deactivate out-of-bound checking.

### Package manager
The [Pkg mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#Pkg-mode) permits you to install and manage Julia packages, and control the project's environment.



<!-- 
## Running the scripts
To get started with the workshop,
1. clone (or download the ZIP archive) the workshop repository ([help here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository))
```sh
git clone https://github.com/luraess/parallel-gpu-workshop-JuliaCon21.git
```
2. Navigate to `parallel-gpu-workshop-JuliaCon21`
```sh
cd parallel-gpu-workshop-JuliaCon21
```
3. From the terminal, launch Julia with the `--project` flag to read-in project environment related informations such as used packages
```sh
julia --project
```
3. From VS Code, follow the [instructions from the documentation](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/stable/gettingstarted/) to get started.

### Packages installation
Now that you launched Julia, you should be in the [Julia REPL]. You need to ensure all the packages you need are installed before using them. To do so, enter the [Pkg mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#Pkg-mode) by typing `]`. Then, `instantiate` the project which should trigger the download of the packages (`st` lists the package status). Exit the Pkg mode with `Ctrl-c`:
```julia-repl
julia> ]

(parallel-gpu-workshop-JuliaCon21) pkg> st
Status `~/parallel-gpu-workshop-JuliaCon21/Project.toml`
    # [...]

(parallel-gpu-workshop-JuliaCon21) pkg> instantiate
   Updating registry at `~/.julia/registries/General`
   Updating git-repo `https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General.git`
   # [...]

julia>
```
To test your install, go to the [scripts](../scripts) folder and run the [`diffusion_2D_expl.jl`](/scripts/diffusion_2D_expl.jl) code. You can execute shell commands from within the [Julia REPL] first typing `;`:
```julia-repl
julia> ;

shell> cd scripts/

julia> include("diffusion_2D_expl.jl")
```
Running this the first time will (pre-)complie the various installed packages and will take some time. Subsequent runs, by executing `include("diffusion_2D_expl.jl")`, should take around 2s.

You should then see a figure displayed showing the nonlinear diffusion of a quantity `H` after `nt=666` steps:

## Multi-threading on CPUs
On the CPU, multi-threading is made accessible via [Base.Threads]. To make use of threads, Julia needs to be launched with
```sh
julia --project -t auto
```
which will launch Julia with as many threads are there are cores on your machine (including hyper-threaded cores).  Alternatively set
the environment variable [JULIA_NUM_THREADS], e.g. `export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=2` to enable 2 threads.

## Running on GPUs
The [CUDA.jl] module permits to launch compute kernels on Nvidia GPUs natively from within [Julia]. [JuliaGPU] provides further reading and [introductory material](https://juliagpu.gitlab.io/CUDA.jl/tutorials/introduction/) about GPU ecosystems within Julia. If you have an Nvidia CUDA capable GPU device, also export following environment vaiable prior to installing the [CUDA.jl] package:
```sh
export JULIA_CUDA_USE_BINARYBUILDER=false
```

## Julia MPI
The following steps permit you to install [MPI.jl] on your machine and test it:
1. Julia MPI being a dependency of this Julia project [MPI.jl] should have been added upon executing the `instantiate` command from within the package manager [see here](#packages-installation).

2. Install `mpiexecjl`:
```julia-repl
julia> using MPI

julia> MPI.install_mpiexecjl()
[ Info: Installing `mpiexecjl` to `HOME/.julia/bin`...
[ Info: Done!
```
3. Then, one should add `HOME/.julia/bin` to PATH in order to launch the Julia MPI wrapper `mpiexecjl`.

4. Running a Julia MPI code `<my_script.jl>` on `np` processes:
```sh
$ mpiexecjl -n np julia --project <my_script.jl>
```

5. To test the Julia MPI installation, launch the [`hello_mpi.jl`](extras/hello_mpi.jl) using the Julia MPI wrapper `mpiexecjl` (located in `~/.julia/bin`) on 4 processes:
```sh
$ mpiexecjl -n 4 julia --project extras/hello_mpi.jl
$ Hello world, I am 0 of 3
$ Hello world, I am 1 of 3
$ Hello world, I am 2 of 3
$ Hello world, I am 3 of 3
```
> ðŸ’¡ Note: On MacOS, you may encounter this issue (https://github.com/JuliaParallel/MPI.jl/issues/407). To fix it, define following `ENV` variable:
```sh
$ export MPICH_INTERFACE_HOSTNAME=localhost
```
> and add `-host localhost` to the execution script:
```sh
$ mpiexecjl -n 4 -host localhost julia --project extras/hello_mpi.jl
``` -->
