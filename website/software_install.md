## Opening and running the Jupyter Julia notebook

### Course slides and lecture material
Most of the course slides are a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/); a browser-based computational notebook.

You can follow the lecture along live at [https://achtzack01.ethz.ch/](https://achtzack01.ethz.ch/), login with your nethz-name and an arbitrary password (**but don't use your nethz password**).  _You have to be within the ETHZ network or use a VPN connection._

Code cells are executed by putting the cursor into the cell and hitting `shift + enter`. For more info see the [documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

### Exercises and homework
The first two lecture's homework assignments will be [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). You'll find them on [https://achtzack01.ethz.ch/](https://achtzack01.ethz.ch/) as well. You can execute them on the server or download and run them them locally as well.

For submission, download the final `.ipynb` notebooks from the server, or collect the local `.ipynb` notebooks into a single local folder you then upload to Moodle. See [Logistics](/logistics) and [Homework](/homework) for details.

Starting from lecture 3, exercise scripts will be mostly standalone regular Julia scripts that have to be uploaded to your private git repo (shared with the teaching staff only). Details in [Logistics](/logistics/#submission).

\warn{The `achtzack01` is **not** backed up. Make sure to keep local copy of your data!}

## Installing Julia v1.6 (or later)
Check you have an active internet connexion and [download Julia v1.6](https://julialang.org/downloads/) for your platform following the install directions provided under **[help]**.

Alternatively, open a terminal and download the binaries (select the one for your platform):
```sh
wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/winnt/x64/1.6/julia-1.6.3-win64.exe # Windows
wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/mac/x64/1.6/julia-1.6.3-mac64.dmg # macOS
wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64/1.6/julia-1.6.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz # Linux x86
```
Then extract them and add Julia to `PATH` (usually done in your `.bashrc`, `.profile`, or `config` file).

> **Note for Windows users**\
> When installing Julia 1.6 on Windows, make sure to check the "Add PATH" tick or ensure Julia is on PATH (see **[help]**). Julia's REPL has a built-in shell mode you can access typing `;` that natively works on Unix-based systems. On Windows, you can access the Windows shell by typing `Powershell` within the shell mode, and exit it typing `exit`, as described [here](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#man-shell-mode).

### Terminal + external editor
Ensure you have a text editor with syntax highlighting support for Julia. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/download) and [Atom](https://atom.io) can be recommended.

From within the terminal, type
```sh
julia
```
to make sure that the Julia REPL (aka terminal) starts. Then you should ba able to add `1+1` and verify you get the expected result. Exit with `Ctrl-d`.

### VS Code
If you'd enjoy a more IDE type of environment, [check out VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Follow the [installation directions](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode#getting-started) for the [Julia VS Code extension](https://www.julia-vscode.org).


## Running Julia

### First steps
Now that you have a running Julia install, launch Julia (e.g. by typing `julia` in the shell since it should be on path)
```sh
julia
```

Welcome in the [Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/) (command window). There, you have 3 "modes", the standard
```julia-repl
[user@comp ~]$ julia
               _
   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org
  (_)     | (_) (_)    |
   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type "?" for help, "]?" for Pkg help.
  | | | | | | |/ _` |  |
  | | |_| | | | (_| |  |  Version 1.6.3 (2021-09-23)
 _/ |\__'_|_|_|\__'_|  |  Official https://julialang.org/ release
|__/                   |

julia> 
```
the shell mode by hitting `;`, where you can enter Unix commands,
```julia-repl
shell> 
```
and the [Pkg mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#Pkg-mode) (package manager) by hitting `]`, that will be used to add and manage packages, and environments,
```julia-repl
(@v1.6) pkg> 
```

You can interactively execute commands in the REPL, like adding two numbers
```julia-repl
julia> 2+2
4

julia>
```
Within this class, we will mainly work with Julia scripts. You can run them using the `include()` function in the REPL
```julia-repl
julia> include("my_script.jl")
```
Alternatively, you can also execute a Julia script from the shell
```sh
julia -O3 --check-bounds=no my_script.jl
```
here passing the `-O3` optimisation flag, and the Julia `--check-bounds` flag set to `no` in order to deactivate out-of-bound checking.

### Package manager
The [Pkg mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#Pkg-mode) permits you to install and manage Julia packages, and control the project's environment.

Environments or Projects are an efficient way that enable portability and reproducibility. Upon activating a local environment, you generate a local `Project.toml` file that stores the packages and version you are using within a specific project (code-s), and a `Manifest.toml` file that keeps track locally of the state of the environment. 

To activate an project-specific environment, navigate to your targeted project folder, launch Julia
```sh
mkdir my_cool_project
cd my_cool_project 
julia
```
and activate it

```julia-repl
julia> ]

(@v1.6) pkg> 

(@v1.6) pkg> activate .
  Activating new environment at `~/my_cool_project/Project.toml`

(my_cool_project) pkg> 
```

Then, let's install the `Plots.jl` package
```julia-repl
(my_cool_project) pkg> add Plots
```
and check the status
```julia-repl
(my_cool_project) pkg> st
      Status `~/my_cool_project/Project.toml`
  [91a5bcdd] Plots v1.22.3
```
as well as the `.toml` files
```julia-repl
julia> ;

shell> ls
Manifest.toml Project.toml
```
We can now load `Plots.jl` and plot some random noise
```julia-repl
julia> using Plots

julia> heatmap(rand(10,10))
```

Let's assume you're handed your `my_cool_project` to someone to reproduce your cool random plot. To do so, you can open julia from the `my_cool_project` folder with the `--project` option
```sh
cd my_cool_project 
julia --project
```

Or you can rather activate it afterwards
```sh
cd my_cool_project 
julia
```
and then,
```julia-repl
julia> ]

(@v1.6) pkg> activate .
  Activating environment at `~/my_cool_project/Project.toml`

(my_cool_project) pkg> 

(my_cool_project) pkg> st
      Status `~/my_cool_project/Project.toml`
  [91a5bcdd] Plots v1.22.3
```

Here we go, you can now share that folder with colleagues or with yourself on another machine and have a reproducible environment ðŸ™‚


## Accessing the GPU resources on `octopus`

The following steps will permit you to access the GPU resources, the [octopus supercomputer](https://wp.unil.ch/geocomputing/octopus/).

Look-up your username (`<username>`) and assigned node (`node`), both listed in [Moodle - General](https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/course/view.php?id=15755#section-0) under `Connecting to the GPU resources (octopus)`. Your password was sent via email.

### Connect to the machine via ssh
```sh
ssh <username>@octopus.unil.ch
```

### Initialise your remote desktop (first time only)
1. On your local machine (laptop), head to [RealVNC's download page](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/) to download the **VNC viewer**.
2. On _octopus_, trigger the remote desktop creation typing in the terminal
    ```sh
    vncserver :<VNC screen>
    ```
    where `<VNC screen>` refers to the screen number.
3. You will get prompted a line
    ```sh
    New 'octopus.unil.ch:<VNC screen> (<username>)' desktop is octopus.unil.ch:<VNC screen>
    ```

### Connect to remote desktop
1. On your local machine (laptop), open **VNCviewer** and paste the address you got prompted at remote desktop creation, i.e., `octopus.unil.ch:<VNC screen>` in the search bar - hit `enter`.
2. Type in the VNC password your received by email and you should be all set.
3. You can open a terminal (upper left corner menu) and follow the next steps:
    - [Login to `node40`](#login_to_node40) (only during lecture 6 and for exercise 1)
    - [Login to your node](#login_to_your_node) (all other coming classes)

\warn{Never "logout" from your remote desktop, just close the VNC viewer window!}

#### Login to node40
This node should only be accessed during lecture 6 and for the exercise 1 (lecture 6).

1. **In your remote desktop**, open a terminal, `ssh` to `node40` enabling graphics redirecting `-YC`
```sh
ssh -YC node40
```
2. Load the required modules:
```sh
module load julia cuda/11.4
```
3. List the available GPU resources:
```sh
nvidia-smi
```
4. Navigate to `/scratch/<username>/lecture06`
```sh
cd /scratch/<username>/lecture06
```
5. Launch Julia
```sh
julia
```
6. Activate and instantiate the project (this should download all packages you need ðŸ™‚)
```julia-repl
julia> ]

(@v1.6) pkg> activate .

(lecture06) pkg> instantiate
```
7. Launch Jupyter
```julia-repl
julia> using IJulia

julia> notebook(dir=pwd())
```
You should see Firefox opening a Jupyter tab (make sure you connected using `-YC` to `node40`).
8. Open the `l6_1-gpu-memcopy.ipynb` notebook. You are all set ðŸš€

\warn{Do not save data in your `/home` as the space is very limited. Always Navigate to your scratch-space `cd /scratch/<username>`, as this is the place where you should work from, save data, etc...}

#### Login to your node
Except for doing the hands-on in lecture 6 and for exercise 1 (lecture 6), you should connect to your corresponding GPU node according to the node list available on [Moodle](https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/course/view.php?id=15755#section-0):
1. From the _octopus_ login node, you can access your compute node typing
```sh
ssh node<node>
```
in your local terminal or in the terminal within the remote desktop (e.g. `ssh node39`).
2. Typing `pwd()` should confirm you are in your `/home` folder.

\warn{Do not save data in your `/home` as the space is very limited. Always Navigate to your scratch-space.}

3. Navigate to your scratch-space
```sh
cd /scratch/<username>
```
as this is the place where you should work from, save data, etc...
4. Load the required modules:
```sh
module load julia cuda/11.4
```
5. Launch Julia
```sh
julia
```
and you are all set ðŸš€



<!-- 
## Running the scripts
To get started with the workshop,
1. clone (or download the ZIP archive) the workshop repository ([help here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository))
```sh
git clone https://github.com/luraess/parallel-gpu-workshop-JuliaCon21.git
```
2. Navigate to `parallel-gpu-workshop-JuliaCon21`
```sh
cd parallel-gpu-workshop-JuliaCon21
```
3. From the terminal, launch Julia with the `--project` flag to read-in project environment related informations such as used packages
```sh
julia --project
```
3. From VS Code, follow the [instructions from the documentation](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/stable/gettingstarted/) to get started.

### Packages installation
Now that you launched Julia, you should be in the [Julia REPL]. You need to ensure all the packages you need are installed before using them. To do so, enter the [Pkg mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#Pkg-mode) by typing `]`. Then, `instantiate` the project which should trigger the download of the packages (`st` lists the package status). Exit the Pkg mode with `Ctrl-c`:
```julia-repl
julia> ]

(parallel-gpu-workshop-JuliaCon21) pkg> st
Status `~/parallel-gpu-workshop-JuliaCon21/Project.toml`
    # [...]

(parallel-gpu-workshop-JuliaCon21) pkg> instantiate
   Updating registry at `~/.julia/registries/General`
   Updating git-repo `https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General.git`
   # [...]

julia>
```
To test your install, go to the [scripts](../scripts) folder and run the [`diffusion_2D_expl.jl`](/scripts/diffusion_2D_expl.jl) code. You can execute shell commands from within the [Julia REPL] first typing `;`:
```julia-repl
julia> ;

shell> cd scripts/

julia> include("diffusion_2D_expl.jl")
```
Running this the first time will (pre-)complie the various installed packages and will take some time. Subsequent runs, by executing `include("diffusion_2D_expl.jl")`, should take around 2s.

You should then see a figure displayed showing the nonlinear diffusion of a quantity `H` after `nt=666` steps:

![](docs/diff2D_expl.png)

## Multi-threading on CPUs
On the CPU, multi-threading is made accessible via [Base.Threads]. To make use of threads, Julia needs to be launched with
```sh
julia --project -t auto
```
which will launch Julia with as many threads are there are cores on your machine (including hyper-threaded cores).  Alternatively set
the environment variable [JULIA_NUM_THREADS], e.g. `export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=2` to enable 2 threads.

## Running on GPUs
The [CUDA.jl] module permits to launch compute kernels on Nvidia GPUs natively from within [Julia]. [JuliaGPU] provides further reading and [introductory material](https://juliagpu.gitlab.io/CUDA.jl/tutorials/introduction/) about GPU ecosystems within Julia. If you have an Nvidia CUDA capable GPU device, also export following environment vaiable prior to installing the [CUDA.jl] package:
```sh
export JULIA_CUDA_USE_BINARYBUILDER=false
```

## Julia MPI
The following steps permit you to install [MPI.jl] on your machine and test it:
1. Julia MPI being a dependency of this Julia project [MPI.jl] should have been added upon executing the `instantiate` command from within the package manager [see here](#packages-installation).

2. Install `mpiexecjl`:
```julia-repl
julia> using MPI

julia> MPI.install_mpiexecjl()
[ Info: Installing `mpiexecjl` to `HOME/.julia/bin`...
[ Info: Done!
```
3. Then, one should add `HOME/.julia/bin` to PATH in order to launch the Julia MPI wrapper `mpiexecjl`.

4. Running a Julia MPI code `<my_script.jl>` on `np` processes:
```sh
$ mpiexecjl -n np julia --project <my_script.jl>
```

5. To test the Julia MPI installation, launch the [`hello_mpi.jl`](extras/hello_mpi.jl) using the Julia MPI wrapper `mpiexecjl` (located in `~/.julia/bin`) on 4 processes:
```sh
$ mpiexecjl -n 4 julia --project extras/hello_mpi.jl
$ Hello world, I am 0 of 3
$ Hello world, I am 1 of 3
$ Hello world, I am 2 of 3
$ Hello world, I am 3 of 3
```
> ðŸ’¡ Note: On MacOS, you may encounter this issue (https://github.com/JuliaParallel/MPI.jl/issues/407). To fix it, define following `ENV` variable:
```sh
$ export MPICH_INTERFACE_HOSTNAME=localhost
```
> and add `-host localhost` to the execution script:
```sh
$ mpiexecjl -n 4 -host localhost julia --project extras/hello_mpi.jl
``` -->
