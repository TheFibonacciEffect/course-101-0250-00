## Discussion
We encourage students to ask questions related to the course and the exercises as well as other technical issues on the course's [Element](https://chat.ethz.ch) chat. Using the chat server should facilitate exchange among students and may provide a knowledge basis useful to everyone.

## Homework
Homework tasks will be announced after each week's lecture. The exercise session following the lecture will get you started. Due date will be by the end of every following week to allow for Q&A during the in-class exercise session.
- Submission of scripts and other documents happens on the course's [Moodle](https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/course/view.php?id=15755).
- Actions and tasks related to GitHub will happen on your private course-related GitHub repository.
