# Logistics

[![Element chat](/assets/element_chat.svg#badge)](https://chat.ethz.ch)
[![Zoom Meeting](/assets/zoom_logo.svg#badge)](https://ethz.zoom.us)
[![ETHZ Moodle](/assets/moodle.png#badge)](https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch)

## Objective
The goal of this course is to offer a practical approach to solve systems of differential equations in parallel on GPUs using the [Julia language](http://www.julialang.org/). Julia combines high-level language conciseness to low-level language performance which enables efficient code development. 

The course will be taught in a hands-on fashion, putting emphasis on you writing code and completing exercises; lecturing will be kept at a minimum.

In a final project you will solve a solid mechanics or fluid dynamics problem of your interest, such as:
- the shallow water equation,
- the shallow ice equation,
- acoustic wave propagation,
- nonlinear diffusion,
- viscous flow or elastic deformation,
- viscous or elastic poromechanics,
- frictional heating,
- and more...

Your Julia GPU application will be hosted on a git-platform and implement modern software development practices.

## Lectures

⚠️ subject to changes

**Live lectures** will take place on Tuesday 13h-16h

**Office hours** schedule tbd (on Element/Zoom or in-person)

## Discussion
We encourage students to ask questions related to the course and the exercises as well as other technical issues on the relevant [Element](https://chat.ethz.ch) room. Using the chat server should facilitate eychange among students and may provide a knowledge basis useful to everyone.

## Evaluation
Enrolled ETHZ students will have to hand in on Moodle:
1. 7 (out of 9) weekly assignments (40% of the final grade) during the course's Parts 1 and 2 _(Weekly coding exercises can be done alone or in groups of two)_.
2. A final project during Part 3 (60% of the final grade) _(Final projects submission includes codes in a git repository and an automatic generated documentation)_.
