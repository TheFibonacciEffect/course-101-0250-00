## Course structure

The course structure includes following 3 items, to bring in new material each course both for the "physics-numerics" (aka physics) and the "code-management" (aka code), as well as propose exercises for those concepts:
- :books: Physics: equations, discretisation, implementation, solver, visualisation
- :computer: Code: technical, Julia, GitHub
- :construction: Exercises

The course will be taught in a hands-on fashion, putting emphasis on you writing code and completing exercises; lecturing will be kept at a minimum.

## Lectures

> ⚠️ **Note:** The following information is subject to changes until the course start, and later-on depending to the evolution of the pandemic. 

### Live lectures | Tuesdays 13h-16h
- In person lectures will take place in [HCI](http://www.mapsearch.ethz.ch/map/mapSearchPre.do?gebaeudeMap=HCI&geschossMap=E&raumMap=8&farbcode=c010&lang=en) [E8](http://www.rauminfo.ethz.ch/Rauminfo/grundrissplan.gif?gebaeude=HCI&geschoss=E&raumNr=8&lang=en).
- Online attendance will be possible on [Zoom](https://ethz.zoom.us) (lecture only).
- **Exercise session** following-up the lecture will not be broadcasted _(no online support will be provided during the exercise session)_.

### Office hours 
Schedule to be defined (on Element/Zoom or in-person)

## Discussion
We encourage students to ask questions related to the course and the exercises as well as other technical issues on the course's [Element](https://chat.ethz.ch) chat. Using the chat server should facilitate exchange among students and may provide a knowledge basis useful to everyone.

## Homework
[Homework](/homework) tasks will be announced after each week's lecture. The exercise session following the lecture will get you started.

Homework **due date will be Thursday 23h59 CET** every following week (9 days) to allow for Q&A during the following in-class exercise session.

Homework assignements can be carried-out by groups of 2. However, **_note that every student has to hand in a version of the homework_**.

- Submission of scripts and other documents happens on the course's [Moodle](https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/course/view.php?id=15755).
- Actions and tasks related to GitHub will happen on your private course-related GitHub repository.

> ➡ Check out the [Homework](/homework) page for an overview on expected hand-in and deadlines.

## Evaluation
Enrolled ETHZ students will have to hand in on [Moodle](https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/course/view.php?id=15755) (& GitHub):
1. 7 (out of 9) weekly assignments (40% of the final grade) during the course's Parts 1 and 2. _**Weekly coding exercises can be done alone or in groups of two**_.
2. A final project during Part 3 (60% of the final grade). _**Final projects submission includes codes in a git repository and an automatic generated documentation**_.
