    "In the folder in your GitHub repository for this week's (lecture 5) exercises, create a new subfolder `acoustic2D` where you will add following script:\n",
    "- `acoustic_2D_Teff.jl`\n",
    "  - Implement the `T_eff` metric to the acoustic wave in 2D. Since we are using the velocity-pressure formulation, think about how many arrays are read / written at every iterations and define `A_Eff` accordingly.\n",
    "  - Use `@printf()` to report `t_toc`, `T_eff` and `niter`.\n",
    "  - Boost the number of grid points to `nx = ny = 512`.\n",
    "  - Implement a flag to deactivate visualisation using kwargs.\n",
    "- `acoustic_2D_perf.jl`\n",
    "  - Replace divisions by multiplications.\n",
    "  - When possible, fuse scalar computations in preprocessing.\n",
    "- `acoustic_2D_perf_loop.jl`\n",
    "  - Perform the computations of `Vx`, `Vy` and `P` in nested loops. Take care of the staggering and loop range.\n",
    "- `acoustic_2D_perf_loop_fun.jl`\n",
    "  - Move the physics computations inside functions (kernels) and call them within the time loop. Use the minimal amount of functions that would ensure correct results.\n",
    "  - Implement multi-threading using both `Threads.@threads` and `@tturbo` (the latter from [LoopVectorization.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSIMD/LoopVectorization.jl))."
