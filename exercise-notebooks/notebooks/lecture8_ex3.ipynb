    "### Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise your task will be to modify the elastic wave code `elastic_2D.jl` from [Exercise 3, Lecture 7](/lecture7/#task_4_-_rearranging_the_code), turning it into a weakly compressible viscous Navier-Stokes flow solver with inertia terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main task will be to modify the shear rheology, now viscous. Viscosity [Pa.s] defines as the ratio between  stress $τ$ and strain-rate $ε̇$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture's Git repository, duplicate the `elastic_2D.jl` renaming it `viscous_NS_2D.jl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the physics in order to implement the weakly compressible Navier-Stokes equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{∂P}{∂t} = -K ∇_k v_k ~,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ τ = μ\\left(∇_i v_j + ∇_j v_i -\\frac{1}{3} δ_{ij} ∇_k v_k \\right) ~,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ ρ \\frac{∂v_i}{∂t} = ∇_j \\left( τ_{ij} - P δ_{ij} \\right) ~,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P$ is the pressure, $v$ the velocity, $K$ the bulk modulus, $μ$ the viscosity, $τ$ the viscous deviatoric stress tensor, $ρ$ the density, and $\\delta_{ij}$ the Kronecker delta.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In a new section of the `README.md` add a figure from code featuring 4 subplots depicting pressure $P$, velocity x-component $v_x$, normal and shear stress components, $\\tau_{xx}$ and $\\tau_{xy}$, respectively, and a short description."
