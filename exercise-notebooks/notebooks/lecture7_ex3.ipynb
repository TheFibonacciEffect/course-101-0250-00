    "The remaining 2 tasks to achieve a full implementation of the 2D elastic wave solver are:\n",

    "- re-arranging the order of computation\n",

For the rate of change of the shear stress $âˆ‚Ï„_{xy}/âˆ‚t$, the shear strain-rate defines as $1/2~(âˆ‚v_x/âˆ‚y + âˆ‚v_y/âˆ‚x)$. Make sure to implement it consistently."
