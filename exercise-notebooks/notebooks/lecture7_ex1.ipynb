    "Vary the number of grid points `nx = ny = 16 * 2 .^ (1:8)` (or until you run out of memory on the GPU). Report as well the value for memory copy $T_\\mathrm{peak}$ of the given GPU (and arithmetic precision) you are using. Make sure to including figure axis labels and add a short figure caption or description to the `README`."
