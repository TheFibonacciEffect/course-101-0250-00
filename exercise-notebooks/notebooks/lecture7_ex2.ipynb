    "- Include the kwarg `do_visu` (or `do_check`) to allow disabling plotting/error-checking when assessing performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Merge the `PorousConvection_2D_xpu.jl` from Exercise 1 and the `Pf_diffusion_3D_xpu.jl` script from previous task to create a 3D single xPU `PorousConvection_3D_xpu.jl` version to run on GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement similar changes as you did in the previous 2 tasks, preferring the `@parallel` (instead of `@parallel_indices`) whenever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to use the `z`-direction as the vertical coordinate changing all relevant expressions in the code, and assume `αρg` to be the gravity acceleration acting only in the `z`-direction. Implement following domain extend and numerical resolution (ratio):"
