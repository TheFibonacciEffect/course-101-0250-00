    "### Task 1\n",
    "Implement the following changes:\n",
    "- Change the domain extend to $L_x=1000$ m, $L_y=500$ m (with origin located in the bottom left corner of the model)\n",
    "- For sandstone, set the elastic moduli $K=40$ GPa and the density $ρ=2400$ Kg/m$^3$\n",
    "- Define a Gaussian function for the source at $t=0$, with centre location $(x_s, y_s)$ at $x_s = 200$ and at $50$ m below the surface. Use a standard deviation of $5$ m and an amplitude of $1$ Pa.\n",
    "- Run the experiment for a total $t_\\mathrm{tot}=0.2$ sec\n",
    "- Set pressure values as `P[:,end] .= P[:,end-1]` in order to minimise boundary effects on the top boundary\n",

    "### Task 2\n",
    "In a second step,\n",
    "- Add 5 monitoring stations located at $y_\\mathrm{monit}$ ~$20$ m below the ground between $x=500$ and $900$ m, distant from each other by $100$ m.\n",
    "- Record and store the pressure in each monitoring station throughout the entire simulation\n",
    "- For the first station (located at $x=500$ m), find the arrival time for which the pressure $P > 0.02$ Pa\n",
    "- Knowing at which time the wave hit the first station, you can post-process and **report following (as formatted output in the REPL or on a figure)**:\n",
    "  - First wave arrival time (in s) at station $x_s=500$ m\n",
    "  - Distance (`∆_dist`) the wave travelled\n",
    "  - $x$-location of the seismic source"
