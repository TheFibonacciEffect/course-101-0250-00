## Exercise 2 - **Multi-xPU computing**
"""

#md # ðŸ‘‰ See [Logistics](/logistics/#submission) for submission details.

md"""
The goal of this exercise is to:
- Familiarise with distributed computing
- Combine [ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl](https://github.com/eth-cscs/ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl) and [ParallelStencil.jl](https://github.com/omlins/ParallelStencil.jl)
- Learn about GPU MPI on the way
"""

md"""
In this exercise, you will:
- Create a multi-xPU version of your thermal porous convection 2D xPU code
- Keep it xPU compatible using `ParallelStencil.jl`
- Deploy it on multiple XPUs using `ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl`
