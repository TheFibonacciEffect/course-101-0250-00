The performance of most scientific applications nowadays is bound by memory access speed (*memory-bound*) rather than by the speed computations can be done (*compute-bound*).

The reason is that current GPUs (and CPUs) can do many more computations in a given amount of time than they can access numbers from main memory.

This situation is the result of a much faster increase of computation speed with respect to memory access speed over the last decades, until we hit the "memory wall" at the beginning of the century:

This imbalance can be quantified by dividing the computation peak performance [GFLOP/s] by the memory access peak performance [GB/s] and multiplied by the size of a number in Bytes (for simplicity, theoretical peak performance values as specified by the vendors can be used). For example for the Tesla P100 GPU, it is:

$$ \frac{5300 ~\mathrm{[GFlop/s]}}{732 ~\mathrm{[GB/s]}}~Ã—~8 = 58 $$

(here computed with double precision values taken from [the vendor's product specification sheet](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/Data-Center/tesla-p100/pdf/nvidia-tesla-p100-PCIe-datasheet.pdf)).

So we can do 58 floating point operations per number read from main memory or written to it.

As a consequence, we can consider **floating point operations be "for free"** when we work in the memory-bounded regime as in this lecture.

Naturally, when realizing that our PDE solvers' are memory-bound, we start to analyze the memory throughput.

In lecture 6, we have though seen that the *total memory throughput* is often not a good metric to evaluate the optimality of an implementation.

As a result, we defined the *effective memory throughput*, $T_\mathrm{eff}$, metric for iterative stencil-based PDE solvers.

The effective memory access $A_\mathrm{eff}$ [GB]
Sum of:
- twice the memory footprint of the unknown fields, $D_\mathrm{u}$, (fields that depend on their own history and that need to be updated every iteration)

#nb # %% A slide [markdown] {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

The effective memory access divided by the execution time per iteration, $t_\mathrm{it}$ [sec], defines the effective memory throughput, $T_\mathrm{eff}$ [GB/s]:

$$ A_\mathrm{eff} = 2~D_\mathrm{u} + D_\mathrm{k} $$

$$ T_\mathrm{eff} = \frac{A_\mathrm{eff}}{t_\mathrm{it}} $$
"""

#src #########################################################################
#nb # %% A slide [markdown] {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

The upper bound of $T_\mathrm{eff}$ is $T_\mathrm{peak}$ as measured, e.g., by [McCalpin, 1995](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51992086_Memory_bandwidth_and_machine_balance_in_high_performance_computers) for CPUs or a GPU analogue.
Defining the $T_\mathrm{eff}$ metric, we assume that:
1. we evaluate an iterative stencil-based solver,
2. the problem size is much larger than the cache sizes and
3. the usage of time blocking is not feasible or advantageous (reasonable for real-world applications).

When solving the [exercises](#exercises_-_lecture_9) later, we invite you to a "time travel"!

We will ask you to solve them first on the consumer electronics GPU Titan Xm in double precision, even though its double precision floating point peak performance is very low; then, we will ask you to rerun your solutions on the Tesla V100 GPUs.

Why do we talk about "time travel"?
"""

It is because the Titan Xm's ratio between compute access speed and memory access speed is much lower for double precision than for single precision.

The ratio for double precision corresponds to what was common in the early 2000s. So we "time-travel" 15 to 20 years back!
