    "## What is convection and why we want to model it\n",
    "\n",
    "Convection is a fluid flow driven by any instability arising from the interaction between the fluid properties such as density, and external forces such as gravity. If a layer of denser fluid lays on top of a layer of fluid with lower density, they will eventually mix and swap. An example of such fluids would be oil and water. In thermal convection, the density difference is caused by the thermal expansion of the fluid, i.e., the dependence of density on temperature. Usually, higher temperatures correspond to the lower densities.\n",

For example, water circulation in hydrothermal systems is caused by thermal convection, and mixing of CO$_2$ with saline water during geological storage results from chemical convection."
